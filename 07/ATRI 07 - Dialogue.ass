Dialogue: 0,0:00:07.75,0:00:09.91,Default,Natsuki,0,0,0,,Atri's that girl from eight years ago? {josei, would be nice to compensate for this somewhere else, though obviously girl is the best word choice here}
Dialogue: 0,0:00:12.82,0:00:15.02,Default,Natsuki,0,0,0,,No! She can't be!
Dialogue: 0,0:00:15.02,0:00:19.17,Default,Natsuki,0,0,0,,That girl back then was so graceful, so mature!
Dialogue: 0,0:00:19.17,0:00:21.99,Default,Natsuki,0,0,0,,She was nothing like... {\i1}this thing!{\i0}
Dialogue: 0,0:00:22.95,0:00:25.30,Default,Atri,0,0,0,,There, there. It'll be all right.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:25.87,0:00:28.45,Default,Natsuki,0,0,0,,Crap. She's already invading my memories.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:29.35,0:00:32.54,Default,Natsuki,0,0,0,,All because she had to go and spout that nonsense!
Dialogue: 0,0:00:33.09,0:00:34.97,Default,Natsuki,0,0,0,,Hey. Atri.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:34.97,0:00:36.47,Default,Atri,0,0,0,,What is it?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:36.87,0:00:38.97,Default,Natsuki,0,0,0,,Wake up. We need to talk.

Dialogue: 0,0:02:33.54,0:02:35.60,Default,Natsuki,0,0,0,,It's just too unrealistic.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.60,0:02:38.08,Default,Natsuki,0,0,0,,There's no way she's the same girl I met eight years ago.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.08,0:02:39.37,Default,Ryuuji,0,0,0,,Oh, it's perfectly realistic.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:39.37,0:02:43.33,Default,Ryuuji,0,0,0,,She's a Humanoid, so her appearance wouldn't change.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:43.33,0:02:45.10,Default,Ryuuji,0,0,0,,Okay, lookin' good.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:45.10,0:02:46.23,Default,Natsuki,0,0,0,,Listen to me!
Dialogue: 0,0:02:51.48,0:02:56.66,Default,Ryuuji,0,0,0,,First of all, Atri matches that girl's physical description with her red eyes and silky hair.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:57.04,0:02:58.57,Default,Natsuki,0,0,0,,That's just a coincidence.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:58.57,0:03:01.50,Default,Ryuuji,0,0,0,,Second of all, if you met this girl when you were nine,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:01.50,0:03:06.80,Default,Ryuuji,0,0,0,,and she looked about fourteen at the time,\N that lines up perfectly with how Atri looks now.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:06.80,0:03:11.92,Default,Natsuki,0,0,0,,Plenty of Humanoids are designed to look like young humans, that isn't any—
Dialogue: 0,0:03:11.92,0:03:13.22,Default,Ryuuji,0,0,0,,Third of all,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:13.22,0:03:15.97,Default,Ryuuji,0,0,0,,she was being kept with Granny Nonko's stuff,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:15.97,0:03:18.43,Default,Ryuuji,0,0,0,,she remembered the song she sang when you first met,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.86,0:03:21.78,Default,Ryuuji,0,0,0,,and to top it all off, she hits you with the "It's been so long, Natsuki{**-san}."
Dialogue: 0,0:03:21.78,0:03:24.31,Default,Ryuuji,0,0,0,,You got a rebuttal for all that as well?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:26.31,0:03:28.34,Default,Minamo,0,0,0,,Natsu{**-kun} actually lost an argument...
Dialogue: 0,0:03:28.34,0:03:30.65,Default,Yoko,0,0,0,,And to freakin' Ryuuji of all people.

Dialogue: 0,0:03:33.42,0:03:34.98,Default,Natsuki,0,0,0,,It's just not possible.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:34.98,0:03:37.82,Default,Natsuki,0,0,0,,Atri can't be that girl!
Dialogue: 0,0:03:38.17,0:03:40.46,Default,Atri,0,0,0,,Natsuki{**-san}! How could you?!
Dialogue: 0,0:03:40.46,0:03:42.67,Default,Atri,0,0,0,,I can't believe you left for school without me!
Dialogue: 0,0:03:42.67,0:03:45.08,Default,Natsuki,0,0,0,,I tried waking you up, but you weren't having it.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:45.08,0:03:50.70,Default,Atri,0,0,0,,A proper wake-up involves taking responsibility for ensuring the other person is well and truly awake!
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.70,0:03:54.06,Default,Atri,0,0,0,,If they go back to sleep, that clearly means you failed to do your job!
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.06,0:03:55.33,Default,Natsuki,0,0,0,,Right, {\i1}my{\i0} job.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:55.88,0:04:00.01,Default,Atri,0,0,0,,Not to mention, I was only sleepy because you woke me up in the middle of the night!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:00.01,0:04:03.53,Default,Atri,0,0,0,,And even after that, you wouldn't stop muttering to yourself until the crack of dawn!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:03.53,0:04:04.39,Default,Minamo,0,0,0,,Really?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:04.73,0:04:09.35,Default,Atri,0,0,0,,Yes, something about proving that someone wasn't me...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:09.81,0:04:11.27,Default,Yoko,0,0,0,,Living rent-free in your head, huh? {!}
Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.65,0:04:16.69,Default,Natsuki,0,0,0,,Of course she is! We're talking about the girl who saved my damn life!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:16.69,0:04:18.61,Default,Natsuki,0,0,0,,And this defective alarm clock ain't her!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:21.22,0:04:24.41,Default,Atri,0,0,0,,That's the last straw! This calls for a double rocket punch!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:24.41,0:04:27.70,Default,Minamo,0,0,0,,I dunno, I think it's touching.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:27.70,0:04:28.71,Default,Natsuki,0,0,0,,Touching?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:29.09,0:04:30.32,Default,Minamo,0,0,0,,Isn't it?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.32,0:04:35.09,Default,Minamo,0,0,0,,You've been apart for so long, but look at you now! You've never been closer!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:35.39,0:04:38.47,Default,Natsuki,0,0,0,,Look, I'm telling you, it's nothing but wishful speculation...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:38.47,0:04:42.39,Default,Yoko,0,0,0,,But she was like, "It's been so long, Natsuki{**-san}," right?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:42.39,0:04:45.31,Default,Atri,0,0,0,,S-So it seems...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:46.23,0:04:47.52,Default,Minamo,0,0,0,,Oh yeah!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:47.52,0:04:51.79,Default,Minamo,0,0,0,,This has to mean you've remembered Natsu{**-kun}'s grandma's orders, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:51.79,0:04:55.15,Default,Minamo,0,0,0,,As well as how you ended up in that capsule.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:55.63,0:04:58.26,Default,Natsuki,0,0,0,,That's right... I forgot all about that!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:58.26,0:05:02.81,Default,Natsuki,0,0,0,,If you remember everything, there'll definitely be {\i1}something{\i0} to prove that girl back then wasn't you!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.81,0:05:03.41,Default,Natsuki,0,0,0,,How about it?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:03.74,0:05:06.67,Default,Atri,0,0,0,,B-But of course!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:06.67,0:05:09.16,Default,Atri,0,0,0,,Y-You can always count on my trusty high specs!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:09.56,0:05:10.67,Default,Minamo,0,0,0,,Really?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:11.57,0:05:13.79,Default,Atri,0,0,0,,Allow me to load the relevant data.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:13.79,0:05:15.37,Default,Atri,0,0,0,,One moment please!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:15.37,0:05:16.17,Default,Atri,0,0,0,,Um...

Dialogue: 0,0:05:31.57,0:05:33.10,Default,Natsuki,0,0,0,,King of Scraplandia, right here.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.25,0:05:37.49,Default,Atri,0,0,0,,How rude!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:37.49,0:05:41.07,Default,Atri,0,0,0,,I'm modeled to resemble a woman, I'll have you know!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:41.07,0:05:44.03,Default,Atri,0,0,0,,You should be calling me a queen, not a king!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:44.03,0:05:45.37,Default,Yoko,0,0,0,,That's the issue?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.37,0:05:50.59,Default,Natsuki,0,0,0,,Well, there you have it. That "it's been so long" was just random nonsense.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.59,0:05:54.00,Default,Natsuki,0,0,0,,And she probably only knew the song 'cause she happened to hear it somewhere before.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.85,0:05:56.67,Default,Atri,0,0,0,,It was at the top of a cliff...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:02.38,0:06:04.50,Default,Atri,0,0,0,,You were sitting in a wheelchair,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:04.50,0:06:07.88,Default,Atri,0,0,0,,and it looked like you were about to tip over the edge at any moment.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:08.68,0:06:14.29,Default,Atri,0,0,0,,As soon as I started singing, that memory came rushing back to me.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:14.29,0:06:18.07,Default,Atri,0,0,0,,Though I can't remember anything else...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.07,0:06:21.07,Default,Yoko,0,0,0,,Yep, pretty sure we've got an open-and-shut case here.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:32.58,0:06:35.08,Default,Ririka,0,0,0,,Whoa...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:38.09,0:06:41.81,Default,Natsuki,0,0,0,,I hate to admit it, but at this point,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.81,0:06:44.59,Default,Natsuki,0,0,0,,I might just have to face the facts...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.96,0:06:46.72,Default,Catherine,0,0,0,,Whatcha writing?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:46.72,0:06:48.35,Default,Natsuki,0,0,0,,Don't peek at my stuff!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:48.87,0:06:50.17,Default,Catherine,0,0,0,,Is it about Atri?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:50.17,0:06:52.43,Default,Natsuki,0,0,0,,I mean—well, yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:59.66,0:07:03.36,Default,Catherine,0,0,0,,You think she might have emotions, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:04.55,0:07:06.11,Default,Natsuki,0,0,0,,How do you know that?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:06.11,0:07:08.18,Default,Catherine,0,0,0,,Minamo told me.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:08.18,0:07:10.12,Default,Catherine,0,0,0,,Wanted to know what I think.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:11.21,0:07:12.12,Default,Natsuki,0,0,0,,What {\i1}do{\i0} you think?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:14.51,0:07:16.49,Default,Catherine,0,0,0,,I think it's definitely possible.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:16.49,0:07:22.01,Default,Catherine,0,0,0,,Even though she lost her memories, she still acts like she's completely devoted to you,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:22.01,0:07:25.91,Default,Catherine,0,0,0,,and it's hard to deny the possibility that real emotions might be the reason why.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:27.79,0:07:33.71,Default,Catherine,0,0,0,,But if she does have a real human heart, you'd better think about how to control her.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:33.71,0:07:34.71,Default,Natsuki,0,0,0,,Control her?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:34.71,0:07:38.43,Default,Catherine,0,0,0,,Our feelings and emotions are what make us humans special.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:38.43,0:07:39.40,Default,Catherine,0,0,0,,But at the same time,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:39.83,0:07:43.90,Default,Catherine,0,0,0,,humans have done stupid and terrible things because of those same feelings and emotions.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:46.78,0:07:49.84,Default,Catherine,0,0,0,,Our emotions are what give rise to acts of love and devotion,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:49.84,0:07:53.23,Default,Catherine,0,0,0,,but they can just as easily be the source of viciousness and violence.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:53.23,0:07:55.40,Default,Catherine,0,0,0,,And the biggest problem of all
Dialogue: 0,0:07:55.40,0:07:59.17,Default,Catherine,0,0,0,,is that no amount of logic can hope to \Nrestrain acts moved by emotion alone. {could easily get fucked over by this passage later}
Dialogue: 0,0:07:59.58,0:08:03.17,Default,Natsuki,0,0,0,,Hence why Humanoids with emotions are considered dangerous.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:03.53,0:08:07.17,Default,Catherine,0,0,0,,You'd better determine whether she really does have emotions.{I'm not clear on what underlying difference between human emotion and simulated emotion... -Pik}
Dialogue: 0,0:08:07.78,0:08:09.11,Default,Catherine,0,0,0,,For your own good.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:16.27,0:08:17.94,Default,Natsuki,0,0,0,,That said, though...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:17.94,0:08:21.96,Default,Natsuki,0,0,0,,How am I even supposed to check for something like that?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:22.55,0:08:25.44,Default,Atri,0,0,0,,Today, Minamo taught me how to make hamburg steak!
Dialogue: 0,0:08:25.44,0:08:26.32,Default,Natsuki,0,0,0,,She did?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:26.67,0:08:27.59,Default,Atri,0,0,0,,Yes!
Dialogue: 0,0:08:27.59,0:08:31.40,Default,Atri,0,0,0,,She's teaching me how to cook as part of our after-school club.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:31.40,0:08:33.41,Default,Atri,0,0,0,,I'll make you some for dinner!
Dialogue: 0,0:08:33.41,0:08:35.34,Default,Natsuki,0,0,0,,Sure you're up to it?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:35.34,0:08:37.20,Default,Atri,0,0,0,,A trivial task for my high specs!
Dialogue: 0,0:08:37.20,0:08:40.65,Default,Atri,0,0,0,,Minamo even complimented me on how fast I learn things!
Dialogue: 0,0:08:41.48,0:08:43.13,Default,Atri,0,0,0,,I'll be on it like a bonnet!
Dialogue: 0,0:08:43.65,0:08:45.92,Default,Natsuki,0,0,0,,You learn that from Minamo, too?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:46.42,0:08:47.84,Default,Atri,0,0,0,,Did I get it wrong?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:57.96,0:08:59.28,Default,Natsuki,0,0,0,,This is how you wear it.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:59.28,0:09:00.83,Default,Atri,0,0,0,,Oh!
Dialogue: 0,0:09:02.09,0:09:02.86,Default,Natsuki,0,0,0,,Are you happy?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:04.58,0:09:05.36,Default,Atri,0,0,0,,Yes!
Dialogue: 0,0:09:11.64,0:09:13.43,Default,Atri,0,0,0,,What was that for?!
Dialogue: 0,0:09:13.43,0:09:14.49,Default,Natsuki,0,0,0,,Are you mad?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:14.49,0:09:16.74,Default,Atri,0,0,0,,I can't believe you! Harrumph!
Dialogue: 0,0:09:17.65,0:09:19.66,Default,Natsuki,0,0,0,,You could call that emotion, I guess,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:19.95,0:09:22.19,Default,Natsuki,0,0,0,,but it's entirely possible this is just her AI
Dialogue: 0,0:09:22.19,0:09:26.79,Default,Natsuki,0,0,0,,serving up believable reactions to pre-programmed situations...
Dialogue: 0,0:09:26.79,0:09:28.00,Default,Natsuki,0,0,0,,In which case...
